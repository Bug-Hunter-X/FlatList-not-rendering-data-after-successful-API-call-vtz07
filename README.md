# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered in React Native applications where a `FlatList` component fails to render data from an API call, even though the API call is successful.  The problem stems from the asynchronous nature of the `fetch` call and how it interacts with the `useState` hook.  The solution showcases a robust approach to managing asynchronous operations and correctly updating the UI.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a component that attempts to fetch data from a REST API and display it using a `FlatList`.  Despite receiving a successful response from the API, the `FlatList` remains empty.  The issue lies in the state updates not triggering a re-render effectively.
